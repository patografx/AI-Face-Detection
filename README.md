# Update
Unfortunately Heroku is not free anymore - good for them - which is why the project is not deployed, and you would have to run the node.js server by yourself to test the code.

## Quick Guide
- Git clone the repository
- run npm start in the /node-server folder
- run npm start in the parent folder (/AI-Face-Decetion)
- make sure, they don't run on the same port (the terminal usually tells you)

## Face Detection App
- A simple login, register page
- API fetch from Clarifai
