# Face Detection App
- A simple login, register page
- API fetch from Clarifai

## Update
Unfortunately Heroku is not free anymore - good for them - which is why the project is not deployed, and you would have to run the node.js server by yourself to test the code.

## Quick Guide
- Git clone the repository
- Add your Clarifai API Key & Token at /AI-Face-Detection/src/app.js
- run npm start in the /node-server folder
- run npm start in the parent folder (/AI-Face-Detection)
- make sure, the server and the frontend don't run on the same port (the terminal usually tells you)
